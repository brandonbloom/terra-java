# Terra-Java

Raw JNI too cumbersome? JNA not fast enough? C++ code generators make you sad?

Try Terra-Java!


## Abstract

Terra-Java leverages Terra's metaprogramming facilities to enable you to
define native JVM extensions with unprecedented ease.

JNI boilerplate is automatically generated during Terra compilation.

Just as Terra can generate native code without a runtime Lua dependency,
Terra-Java can generate JVM extensions without a Terra-Java dependency.


## Status

This project is a work-in-progress. Nothing really works as advertised yet.


## Getting Started
